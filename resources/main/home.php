          <h2>Leading the Way</h2>

          <div class="text">
            <p>Crescent Services was founded in 2006 to address the demand for well-site support and logistic services
              to
              the oilfield. Crescent has grown to over 700 employees with locations in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas,
              Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, Louisiana, and Wyoming, with plans to expand to other states. Our corporate
              headquarters is located in Oklahoma City, OK.
            </p>

            <p>Our services cover the life cycle of a well, from location construction through production. Crescent
              breaks
              down our service lines into two primary segments: Water Management and Environmental Services. We also
              offer
              a variety of rental items to serve customer needs.</p>

            <p>
              Our ownership and management understand what issues are facing operators in the current market and we
              tailor
              our services to assist operators to achieve maximum success while respecting the environment.
